# CriticalFileFinder
Tool used to find the critical files on the server

Hello Guys I'm BedyaEG 

First At All This is A Beta Version Of The tool .. Which Means That This Tool is under update  ;) 

And on the feature there will be a alot of features 

Now Why I request To read this file :) 

Firs At All You Need To Know The Diffrent Between The Custom And The Default Choice :) 

Look Default is have a For Example : http://google.com with out This Sign "/" Which means the Program is auto complete now if you want to search in spicific dir just type for example : http://google.com/dir But At The end of the /dir Don't put "/" Like /dir/ no the program will auto complete :)  after the program will auto complete "/" he will start search after this sign "/" That's It (Automatic)

now with the custom one you can put your dir by you own custome for example : http://google.com/config/ Here You Can See That I put "/" at the end of the site which means that this is not auto complete 

Okay Now You're Good To Go :)
At The Feautre I Will Be use a Sys.Argv Module To Simplify All of this work :)
